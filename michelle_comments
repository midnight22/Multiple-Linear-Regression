Changes / additions to be made:

Add more of description between steps about what you are doing why. 
Salary is skewed and should be transformed before running the regression.
The reported correlations are incorrect - correlations cannot be larger than 1. 
The variables should be standardised before running the regression to be able to get standardised coefficients that you can compare to each other.
Interpret the RMSE differences - is the model overfit or does it seem good?
